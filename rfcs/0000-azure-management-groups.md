# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This RFC proposes a solution for structuring management groups in Azure for Altinn. Management Groups are highly useful for structuring and managing resources across subscriptions, teams, products, and environments. A well-organized structure establishes the foundation for maintaining Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Azure Policies consistently across all teams within Altinn.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

There are several key reasons why structuring Altinn resources into Azure Management Groups is essential:

There's been occasions where teams requiring access to Azure resources creates a ticket for the platform team. This workflow involves detailing who needs access to which resources, even though this information is often already well-known within the requesting team. The platform team, however, doesn't need such specific details and shouldn't be burdened with managing access for every individual team. This leads to several inefficiencies:

* Delays in Access: Teams must wait for the platform team to prioritize and process the ticket, which can delay their progress.
* Architects' Time: Technical architects, who are already occupied with higher-priority tasks, are forced to spend time writing these tickets. Managing IAM for Azure resources is something architects should have the authority to handle within their own teams, without needing to involve the platform team.
* Unnecessary Overhead and Costs: Every access request consumes time in platform meetings, with resources spent discussing and prioritizing minor tasks. This results in direct and opportunity costs, as teams are slowed down and platform resources are inefficiently used.

Implementing a hierarchy of Azure Management Groups offers significant advantages in terms of cost management and accountability. This structure enables efficient tracking of cloud spending and budgeting across different teams within Altinn. While cost management is not typically a top priority for technical teams, automating certain tasksâ€”such as cost tracking and reportingâ€”can provide valuable insights for the finance department, helping to streamline financial operations and ensure budgetary control.

A management group structure that mirrors our internal communication patterns will provide a uniform picture across the organization, ensuring consistency and clarity across teams. This approach streamlines processes, enhances template usage, and fosters improved collaboration between teams. By empowering each team to work within familiar guardrails, we create an environment where individuals can operate more effectively. Embracing such a structure simplifies governance and communication, allowing teams to seamlessly collaborate across departments with a well-known and cohesive setup.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

The proposed structure of Azure Management Groups and Azure AD Groups is designed to reflect Altinn's internal organizational structure. The terminology used for the management groups should align with the language and communication patterns already familiar within Altinn. `Altinn Products` are managed by product teams that serve external customers, or service owners, and are responsible for billing. These teams focus on delivering products and services to clients. On the other hand, `Altinn Capabilities` consist of internal teams that do not necessarily sell products but instead contribute by providing insights, maintaining the Altinn platform, and developing internal applications. The terminology and grouping mirror how these teams operate and communicate within Altinn, ensuring that the structure is intuitive and aligns with the way the organization functions.

**__NOTE:__** `Capabilties` is not well-known (yet). Probably should pick a better name

To manage access to these Management Groups and their connected subscriptions, a set of Azure AD Groups are assigned specific roles for each Management Group. These Azure AD groups are dynamic as it contains a set of individuals which are managed by selected administrators. The administrators of these groups shouldn't need to set direct access to any azure resources, they can administrate access to resources by adding and removing members in an AD group. However, there are cases where you need some sort of direct access or should need to make some tailored IAM permission, where role the `User Access Administrator` comes in handy. The defaullt Azure AD roles include:

* **Readers**: Have read-only access for monitoring and oversight.
* **Developers**: Have contributor-level access to make changes within their environment.
* **Admins**: Have full contributor access, along with administrative privileges to manage IAM within their scope.

An additional layer of control is implemented through Altinn's use of AI-DEV and AI-PROD users when accessing Azure resources. The AI-DEV users are restricted to Dev and Test Subscriptions, while AI-PROD users are granted access to Staging and Prod Subscriptions. This separation is enforced as follows:

* **AI-DEV** users are assigned to AD Groups linked to Dev Management Groups, ensuring they only have access to Dev-related resources.
* **AI-PROD** users are assigned to AD Groups tied to Prod Management Groups, restricting their access to Staging and Prod resources.

**__NOTE:__** Should clarify distinction between AI-DEV and AI-PROD

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation
We propose using a Terraform-based solution to organize Azure Management Groups, with the hierarchical structure defined in YAML configuration files. This approach ensures consistency across teams and simplifies the creation and management of these groups within Azure as we can create a single terraform module to create proposed setup. 

```yaml
# altinn-products.yaml
section:
  name: Products
    components:
    - name: Authorization
      slug: AP-Authorization
    - name: Studio
      slug: AP-Studio
    - name: Dialogporten
      slug: AP-Dialogporten
    - name: Apps
      slug: AP-Apps
``` 

```yaml
# altinn-capabilities.yaml
section:
  name: Capabilities
    components:
    - name: Core
      slug: AC-Core
    - name: Platform
      slug: AC-Platform
```

```yaml
# service-owner.yaml
section:
  name: Service-Owner
  components:
  - name: <Name of Service Owner>
    slug: SO-<Name of Service Owner>
```

Each YAML file defines the organizational units under the corresponding Management Group category. These files will later be extended to include OpenID Connect (OIDC) and tfstate configuration for each organizational unit. However, these aspects are outside the scope of this RFC.


The slug serves as a human-readable identifier, used when creating resources in Terraform. Each resource linked to a specific organizational unit is prefixed with its corresponding slug, ensuring unique resource identifiers across teams. It is crucial not to change these slugs once establishedâ€”any modification will result in the deletion and recreation of all resources managed by the project.

The proposed Terraform folder structure will follow this pattern:
```
infrastructure/
  terraform/
    projects/
      altinn-products
      altinn-capabilties
      service-owners
    modules/
      iam
      tfstate (not part of RFC)
      oidc (not part of RFC)
```

The module `iam` will handle the creation of Management Groups and Azure AD Groups. The module will:
* Read the YAML configuration files.
* Create the top-level Management Groups (specified in file).
* module will create two management groups for each `section.component`: one for Dev (AI-DEV) and one for Prod (AI-PROD).

As iam is just a module, the projects that acutally use this module should be using it as following.
```terraform
# altinn-products/main.tf

module "iam" {
  source              = "../../modules/iam"
  file = ../../../altinn-products.yaml

  ... 
}
```

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks
* **Reorganization Challenges**: If Altinn undergoes a reorganization, adapting this structure to a new organizational model could be complex and time-consuming. Each management group is tightly coupled with its respective team or organizational unit. A reorganization would require updating management groups, Azure AD groups, and role assignments.

* **Risk of Slug Changes**: The slug serves as a identifier for resources. Any accidental changes to a slug would lead to Terraform interpreting it as a new resource, resulting in the deletion and recreation of associated resources.

* **Production Environment Only**: Mistakes in configuring or modifying management groups could have far-reaching impacts. Since management groups span across subscriptions and environments, errors in permissions, resource assignments, or group structure may disrupt multiple teams simultaneously.

* **Scalability Issues**: Although the proposed structure might work well with Altinn's current setup, as the number of teams, products, and environments grows, maintaining this structure could become increasingly complex.

* **Limited Flexibility**: Once this structure is implemented, there is limited room for customization at the team level. Teams will be required to operate within the guardrails set by the platform.

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives
**Rationale**:
* **Consistency Across Teams**: The main goal of this RFC is to standardize the creation and management of resources within Azure by leveraging a Terraform-based solution. 
* **Efficiency**: Empowering teams to manage their own IAM needs reduces dependencies on the platform team, reducing delays and allowing teams to work autonomously within predefined boundaries.

* **Security and Governance**: By using management groups, Altinn can implement streamline governance policies and cost-tracking measures across all teams. This allows for better enforcement of security standards, as well as consistent application of policies such as Azure policies or cost-tracking tools.

# Prior art

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions
* Terminology for "Altinn Capabilities": The term "Capabilities" may not accurately capture the nature of these internal teams.
* AI-DEV and AI-PROD Distinctions: The distinction between AI-DEV and AI-PROD users needs defined boundaries.
* Service Owners structure to be defined.
