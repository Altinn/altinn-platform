# Main tags configuration file
# This file serves as the primary entry point for the tags module

# All logic is defined in other files:
# - variables.tf: Input variable definitions and validation
# - locals.tf: Tag computation and normalization logic
# - outputs.tf: Output definitions for consuming modules
# - providers.tf: Provider requirements and version constraints

# This file intentionally kept minimal to maintain clear separation of concerns
