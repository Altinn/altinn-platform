# Altinn K6 Action Image
Default image used for Altinn's K6 Github action.

## Maintenance
Whenever we upgrade the k8s version on the cluster / we get notified of an upgrade, we should bump the dependencies.

### New trivy alerts
This image is set up with Trivy to scan for vulnerabilities. If any vulnerabilities are found, the workflow will fail.

#### Managing Vulnerabilities
1. **False Positives**: If an alert is a false positive, add the CVE ID to `.trivyignore`
2. **Accepted Risks**: For known risks that have been assessed and accepted:
   - Add the CVE ID to `.trivyignore`
   - Add a comment above the CVE explaining:
     - Why the risk is acceptable
     - Any mitigating controls in place
     - When the decision should be reviewed
