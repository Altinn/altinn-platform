# promrule-to-azpromrulegroup
This controller is intended to sync PrometheusRule CRs created by Pyrra (and not picked up by the Managed Prometheus) with Azure PrometheusRuleGroups.

## Description
We are using the [Managed Prometheus from Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview) instead of operating a Prometheus instance ourselves.
This makes some things easier but adds other complexities.
One problem we have at the moment is the fact that [Pyrra](https://github.com/pyrra-dev/pyrra) generated resources ([PrometheusRule](https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/getting-started/design/#prometheusrule) CRs or ConfigMaps) are not automatically picked up by the managed Prometheus.
This custom controller provides the glue required to connect the two systems by watching the PrometheusRule CRs generated by Pyrra and managing the equivalent resource in Azure ([PrometheusRuleGroup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-rule-groups)).

The controller does not manage any Custom Resource itself; It only watches the PrometheusRule CRs and adds a finalizer to them to make sure it can cleanup the Azure resources related to the CR.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.22.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/promrule-to-azpromrulegroup:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/promrule-to-azpromrulegroup:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/promrule-to-azpromrulegroup:tag
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/promrule-to-azpromrulegroup/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
